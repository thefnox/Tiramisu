How to use the gamemode:

Once you have set yourself as an administrator for your server (In Singleplayer you are superadministrator by default), you can then press tab, right click anywhere in the world, and you will see a bunch of context sensitive options come up. Get used to this menu, you can do anything in this gamemode through it.

You can create new groups, new items, new weapons, new containers, change your name, change your title, use administration options and even more through context sensitive menus. All you need to do is press Tab, right click anywhere and anything in the world, (Hint: That includes yourself), and see what options come up.

You are free to do whatever you please in Tiramisu. The gameplay is entirely up to you and how you want to run it in your server. If you don't like a certain feature in Tiramisu, or you would like to change a certain parameter, just open up the configuration.lua file, and you can change any of the myriad configuration settings available, so you can easily tailor the gamemode to your needs. Tiramisu is free to distribute, modify, and sell, without restrictions for commercial or personal applications.
